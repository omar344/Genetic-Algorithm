Genetic Algorithm (GA)
This repository contains an implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the problem of finding the shortest path between two cities. The GA is a heuristic search algorithm inspired by the process of natural selection and evolution. It can be applied to various optimization and search problems, including the traveling salesman problem (TSP).

Overview
The GA works by iteratively evolving a population of candidate solutions (chromosomes) toward better solutions. Each chromosome represents a potential solution to the problem, and the algorithm uses mechanisms such as selection, crossover, and mutation to produce new generations of chromosomes with improved fitness.

Main Steps of the Genetic Algorithm
Initialization:

Generate an initial population of chromosomes randomly or using some heuristic method.
Evaluation:

Evaluate the fitness of each chromosome in the population based on the objective function (e.g., total distance of the path).
Selection:

Select a subset of chromosomes from the current population to become parents for the next generation.
Common selection methods include roulette wheel selection, tournament selection, and rank-based selection.
Crossover:

Create new offspring chromosomes by combining genetic material from selected parent chromosomes.
Common crossover methods include one-point crossover, two-point crossover, and uniform crossover.
Mutation:

Introduce random changes to the offspring chromosomes to maintain genetic diversity and explore new regions of the search space.
Mutation typically involves randomly altering some genes (e.g., swapping two cities in a route).
Replacement:

Replace the least fit individuals in the current population with the newly created offspring.
This ensures that the population size remains constant across generations.
Termination:

Repeat the selection, crossover, mutation, and replacement steps for a certain number of generations or until a termination criterion is met (e.g., reaching a maximum number of iterations, convergence).
